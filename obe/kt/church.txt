===== Definition: Définition: =====

In the Bible, the term "church" refers to a local group of believers in Jesus who regularly meet together to pray and hear God's word preached. It can also refer to all Christians.

Dans la Bible, le terme "église" se réfère à un groupe local de croyants en Jésus qui se réunissent régulièrement pour prier et écouter la Parole de Dieu qui est prêchée. Il peut aussi se référer à tous les Chrétiens.

  * When this term is used to refer to all believers everywhere in the whole body of Christ, some Bible translations capitalize it (Church) to distinguish it from the local church.
  * Quand on emploie ce terme en référence à tous les croyants du monde dans le Corps de Christ, quelques traductions bibliques l'écrivent avec une majuscule (Eglise)pour le distinguer de l'église locale.
  * The original meaning of this term is "called out (to meet together)." It refers to an assembly or gathering of people for a special purpose.
  * Le sens original de ce term est "appelé hors de (pour s'assembler ensemble)", en référence à une assemblée ou un rassemblement de personnes pour un but bien précis.
  * In the Bible, "church" does not refer to a building.
  * dans la Bible, "église" ne se réfère pas à un bâtiment.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * The term "church" could be translated as a "gathering together" or "assembly" or "congregation" or "ones who meet together."
  * The word or phrase that is used to translate this term should also be able to refer to all believers, not just one small group.
  * Make sure that the translation of "church" does not just refer to a building.
  * Also consider how it is translated in a local or national Bible translation. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown|How to Translate Unknowns]].)
