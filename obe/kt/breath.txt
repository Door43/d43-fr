In the Bible the term "breathed" is used figuratively to refer to giving life or having life.

Dans la Bible le terme"souffla" est employé au sens figuré pour parler de donner la vie ou d'être vivant.

  * The Bible teaches that God "breathed into" Adam the breath of life. It was at that point that Adam became a living soul.
  * La Bible déclare que Dieu "souffla en" Adam le souffle de vie. A ce moment là Adam devint un être vivant.
  * In the time of the great flood, the Bible says that every creature that "breathed" was drowned in the water.
  * Au temps du déluge, la Bible dit que toute créature qui "respirait" fut noyée dans l'eau.
  * Jesus breathed on the disciples and said "Receive the Spirit". This probably refers to literally breathing out air onto them.
  * Jésus souffla sur ses disciples et dit" recevez l'Esprit." Cela veut dire probablement  qu'Il  souffla littéralement de l'air sur eux.
  * Sometimes the term "breathing" or "breathing out" can refer to speaking.

==== Translation Suggestions ====

  * The phrase "breathed his last" is a figurative way of saying "he died." It could also be translated as, "he took his last breath" or "he stopped breathing and died."
  * Describing the Scriptures as "God-breathed" means that God spoke or inspired the words of the Scriptures that human authors wrote down. It could be translated as, "inspired by God" or "authored by God" or "spoken by God." It could be also be said that "God breathed out the words of Scripture."
  * It is probably best if possible to translate "God-breathed" somewhat literally since it is difficult to communicate the exact meaning of this.
