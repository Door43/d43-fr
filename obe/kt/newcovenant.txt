===== Examples from the Bible stories: =====

  * **[[:fr:obs:notes:frames:21-05|[21-05]]]** Through the prophet Jeremiah, God promised that he would make a **New Covenant**, but not like the covenant God made with Israel at Sinai. In the **New Covenant**, God would write his law on the people's hearts, the people would know God personally, they would be his people, and God would forgive their sins. The Messiah would start the **New Covenant**.
  * **[[:fr:obs:notes:frames:21-14|[21-14]]]** Through the Messiah's death and resurrection, God would accomplish his plan to save sinners and start the **New Covenant**.
  * **[[:fr:obs:notes:frames:38-05|[38-05]]]** Then Jesus took a cup and said, "Drink this. It is my blood of the **New Covenant**  that is poured out for the forgiveness of sins. Do this to remember me every time you drink it."
  * **[[:fr:obs:notes:frames:48-11|[48-11]]]** But God has now made a **New Covenant**  that is available to everyone. Because of this **New Covenant**, anyone from any people group can become part of God's people by believing in Jesus.
