====== death, die, dead (La mort, mourir,mort) ======

====== les Faits: ======  

===== Definition: =====

This term is used in two different ways in the Bible. Physically, it often refers to when the physical body of a person stops living. It is also used to refer to sinners being separated from a holy God.

  * "Death" is the opposite of "life."
  * In the Bible, physical life and death are often compared to spiritual life and death.

=== 1. Physical death ===

  * To "die" means to stop living. Death is the end of physical life.
  * A person's spirit leaves his body when he dies.
  * Physical death is the result of the sin of Adam and Eve.

=== 2. Spiritual death ===

  * Spiritual death is the separation of a person from God.
  * Adam died spiritually when he disobeyed God. He became ashamed and tried to hide from God.
  * Every descendant of Adam is a sinner, and is spiritually dead. God makes us spiritually alive again when we have faith in Jesus Christ.

===== Définition: =====

  * Dans la Bible, la vie et la mort physique sont souvent comparées à la vie et la mort spirituelle.

**1.**  **La mort physique**

  * "Mourir" signifie s'arrrêter de vivre.
  * L'esprit (l'âme) d'une personne quitte son corps quand elle est morte.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * To translate this term, it is best to use the everyday, natural word or phrase that refers to death in the target language.
  * In some languages, "to die" may be expressed as "to not live." The term "dead" may be translated as "not alive" or "not having any life."
  * Many languages use figurative expressions to describe death, such as "to pass away" in English. However in the Bible it is best to use the most direct term for death that is used in everyday language, unless that would be offensive.
  * It is important in a translation to use the same word or phrase for both physical death and spiritual death. In some languages it may be more clear to say "spiritual death" when the context requires that meaning. Some translators may also feel it is best to say "physical death" in some contexts where it is being contrasted to spiritual death.
