====== Yahweh(YahvÃ©) ======

===== Facts: Les Faits: =====
The term "Yahweh" is God's personal name that he revealed when he spoke to Moses at the burning bush.
 
===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * Translators may want to translate references to Yahweh in the Old Testament with phrases such as, "I am Yahweh, the Lord your God" and "Yahweh, who is the Lord God." This would show that "Lord" in the New Testament often refers to Yahweh in the Old Testament.
  * This term could be translated by a word that means "I am."
