===== Definition: Définition =====

The term "body" literally refers to the physical body of a person or animal. This term is also used figuratively to refer to a whole group or entity that has individual members.

On utilise le terme "corps"pour désigner la partie physique d'une personne ou d'un animal.

  * When Jesus said to the disciples at his last Passover meal, "This (bread) is my body," he was referring to his physical body that would be "broken" (killed) to pay for their sins.
  * Lorsque Jésus dit à ses disciples au cours de son dernier repas de Pâque, "ceci (pain) est mon corps," Il parlait de son corps physique qui serait " brisé" (tué) pour payer la dette de leurs péchés.
  * In the Bible, Christians as a group are referred to as the "Body of Christ."
  * Dans la Bible, des chrétiens en tant que groupe sont désignés en tant que "Corps de Christ."
  * Just as a physical body has many parts, the "Body of Christ" has many individual members.
  * Comme le corps humain a plusieurs parties, le "corps de Christ" comprend plusieurs membres individuels.
  * Each individual believer has a special function in the Body of Christ to help the whole group work together to serve God and bring him glory.
  * Chaque individu croyant a une fonction spéciale dans le Corps de Christ pour aider tout le groupe à fonctionner ensemble pour le service et la gloire de Dieu.
  * Jesus is also referred to as the "Head" (leader) of the "Body" of his believers. Just as a person's head tells his body what to do, so Jesus is the one who guides and directs Christians as members of his "Body."
  * Jésus est aussi "la tête" (leader) du "Corps" de ses croyants. Tout comme comme la tête d'une personne commande au corps ce qu'il faut faire, Jésus guide également et dirige les Chrétiens " en tant que membres de Son "Corps".

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * The best way to translate this term would be with the most common word in the language that is used to refer to a person's physical body.
  * Make sure that the word used is not an offensive term.
  * When referring collectively to believers, for some languages it may be more natural and accurate to say, "spiritual body of Christ."
  * When Jesus says, "This is my body" it is best to translate this literally, with a note to explain it if needed.
  * Some languages may have a separate word when referring to a dead body, such as "corpse" for a person or "carcass" for an animal. Make sure the word used makes sense in the context and is acceptable.
