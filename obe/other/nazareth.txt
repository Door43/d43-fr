====== Nazareth, Nazarene(Nazareth, NazarÃ©en)  ======


===== Facts: =====

Nazareth is a town in the region of Galilee in northern Israel.
 
  *  Joseph and Mary were from Nazareth, and this is where they raised Jesus. That is why Jesus was known as "the Nazarene."
  * Many of the Jews living in Nazareth did not respect Jesus' teaching, because he had grown up among them and they thought he was just an ordinary person.
  * Once when Jesus was teaching in the Nazareth synagogue, the Jews there tried to kill him because he claimed to be the Messiah and had rebuked them for rejecting him.
  * Nathanael's remark when he heard that Jesus was from Nazareth indicates that this city was not thought of very highly.
