===== Definition: Définition: =====

In the Bible, both "fountain" and "spring" are translations of a word that refers to water that comes up naturally from the ground or some other flowing water source.

Dans la Biblie, à la fois "fontaine" et "source" sont des traductions d'un mot qui fait  référence à l'eau qui jaillit naturellement du sol ou de quelqu'autre source d'eau courante.

  * These words are also used figuratively in the Bible to refer to a source of blessings from God.
  * On utilise aussi ces mots  dans la Bible au sens figuré pour se référer à la source de bènédictions provenant de Dieu.
  * In modern times, a fountain is usually a manmade object that has water flowing out of it such as a drinking fountain, so it may be better to use a word or phrase that only refers to a natural source of flowing water.
  * Zechariah 13:1 says, "A fountain will be opened to the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to cleanse them from sin and impurity."
  * Mark 5:29, of the woman with the issue of blood, says, "And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up."
