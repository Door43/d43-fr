====== Isaac(Isaac) ======

====== les Faits: ======  

Isaac was the son that God promised to give Abraham and Sarah even though they were very old.

    * The name "Isaac" means "he laughs." When God told Abraham that Sarah would give birth to a son, Abraham laughed because they were both very old. Some time later, Sarah also laughed when she heard this news.
  *   But God fulfilled his promise and Isaac was born to Abraham and Sarah in their old age.
  * God told Abraham that the covenant he had made with Abraham would also be for Isaac and his descendants forever.
  * When Isaac was a youth, God tested Abraham's faith by commanding him to sacrifice Isaac.
  * Isaac's son Jacob had twelve sons whose descendants later became the twelve tribes of the nation of Israel.
