====== sacrifice, offering(sacrifice, offrande) ======

===== Definition: =====
In the Bible, the terms "sacrifice" and "offering" refer to special gifts given to God as an act of worshiping him. People also offered sacrifices to false gods.

  * The word "offering" generally refers to anything that is offered or given. The term "sacrifice" refers to something that is given or done at great cost to the giver.
  * Offerings to God were specific things that he commanded the Israelites to give in order to express devotion and obedience to him.
  * The names of the different offerings, such as "burnt offering" and "peace offering," indicated what kind of offering was being given.
  * Sacrifices to God often involved the killing of an animal.
  * Only the sacrifice of Jesus, God's perfect, sinless Son, can completely cleanse people from sin. Animal sacrifices could never do that.
  * The figurative expression "offer yourselves as a living sacrifice" means, "live your life in complete obedience to God, giving up everything in order to serve him."
