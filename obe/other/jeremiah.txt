===== Examples from the Bible stories: =====

  ***[[:fr:obs:notes:frames:19-17|[19-17]]]** Once, the prophet **Jeremiah** was put into a dry well and left there to die. He sank down into the mud that was in the bottom of the well, but then the king had mercy on him and ordered his servants to pull **Jeremiah** out of the well before he died. Une fois le prophète **Jérémie** fut placé dans un puits sec et laissé là pour qu'il meurt. Jérémie s'enfonça dans la boue au fond du puits, mais le roi eut pitié de lui et il ordonna à ses serviteurs de le sortir du puits avant qu'il ne meure.
  ***[[:fr:obs:notes:frames:21-05|[21-05]]]** Through the prophet **Jeremiah**, God promised that he would make a New Covenant, but not like the covenant God made with Israel at Sinai. Par le biais du prophète Jérémie, Dieu promit qu'Il ferait une Nouvelle Alliance, mais pas comme l'alliance qu'il avait faite avec Israël au Mont Sinaï.
