====== Enoch/Hénoc ======

====== les Faits: ======

The Enoch who is mentioned several times in the Old and New Testaments was the father of Methuselah and the great-grandfather of Noah.

Enoch mentionné plusieurs fois dans l'Ancien et le Nouveau Testaments était le père de Mathusalem et l'arrière grand-père de Noé.

  * Enoch had a close relationship with God.
  * Enoch vécut en communion avec Dieu.
  * When he was 365 years old, he was taken up to be with God without dying.
  * A l'âge de 365 ans, il fut enlevé par Dieu sans mourir.
  * This Enoch was descended from Seth. He was a different man from the Enoch whose father was Cain. Some languages may prefer to spell the names of these two men a little bit differently from each other to make it clear that they were two different people.
