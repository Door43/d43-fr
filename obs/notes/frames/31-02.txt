**Meanwhile**, the **disciples** were **rowing their boat**, but by late in the night they had only traveled as far as the middle of the lake. They were rowing with **great difficulty** because the wind was blowing hard against them.

Pendant ce temps, les disciples ramaient mais quand la nuit arriva ils n'étaient qu'au milieu du lac. Ils ramaient avec beaucoup de difficulté, car la barque était battue par un fort vent contraire.
