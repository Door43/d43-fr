**God confused the Midianites**, so that they started attacking and killing each other. Immediately, **the rest of the Israelites were called** from their homes to come help chase the Midianites. They killed many of them and chased the rest of them out of the Israelites' land. 120,000 Midianites died that day. God had **saved Israel**.

Dieu embrouilla les Madianites pour qu'ils tournent l'épée les uns contre les autres. Immédiatement, les autres Israélites furent appelés de leurs maisons pour aider à chasser les Madianites. Ils tuèrent beaucoup de Madianites et chassèrent ceux qui restaient du pays des Israélites- 120,000 Madianites moururent ce jour là. Dieu sauva Israël!
