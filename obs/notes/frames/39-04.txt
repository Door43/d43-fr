{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-39-04.jpg?nolink&}}

Jesus said, “**I am**, and you will see me **seated with God and coming from heaven**.” The **high priest tore his clothes in anger** and shouted to the other **religious leaders**, “We do not need any more **witnesses**! You have heard him say that he is the **Son of God**. **What is your judgment**?”

Jésus lui répondit: “Je le suis, vous me verrez siéger à la droite du Tout-Puissant et venir en gloire sur les nuées du ciel.” De rage, le Grand Prêtre déchira ses vêtements et cria aux autres Chefs religieux: “Nous n'avons pas besoin d'autres témoins! Vous venez vous-mêmes de l'entendre dire qu'Il est le Fils de Dieu. Quel est votre verdict?”

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **I am** - That is, "I am as you said" or, "I am the Messiah and the Son of God." "I am" is also the name of God (See **[[:fr:obs:notes:frames:09-14|[09-14]]]**). By saying simply, "I am" Jesus was also saying that he is God. If possible, translate this so that people will see a similarity between Jesus' answer and the name of God.
  * **seated with God** - This could be translated as, "reigning with God." Because God is the ruler over all, people talk about him as sitting on a throne in heaven. By saying that he would be seated with God, Jesus claimed that he had authority to rule with the Father.
  * **seated with God and coming from heaven** - This could be translated as, "sitting beside God and then coming from heaven."
  * **tore his clothes in anger** - The Jews would tear their clothes to show grief or anger. If tearing the clothes means something else in your language, you may want to substitute a phrase such as, "he was extremely angry."
  * **What is your judgment?** - That is, "What is your decision?" or, "Tell us what have you decided: Is he innocent or guilty?" The chief priest wanted the religious leaders to condemn Jesus for claiming to be equal with God.
