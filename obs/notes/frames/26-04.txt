Then **Jesus** sat down. Everybody watched him closely. They knew the passage of **scripture** that he had just read referred to the **Messiah**. Jesus said, “**The words I just read to you are happening right now**.” All the people were **amazed**. “**Isn’t this the son of Joseph**?” they said.

Tout le monde avait le regard fixé sur Lui. Ils savaient tous que la partie des Saintes Ecritures qu'il venait de lire parlait du Messie. Jésus dit: “Cette parole de l'Écriture, que je viens de vous lire, est accomplie.” Tout le monde était étonné. “N'est-ce pas le fils de Joseph?” dirent-ils.</font>

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **The words I just read to you are happening right now** - Other ways to translate this would be, "The words you just heard me read are being fulfilled right now" or, "Today the words I read to you came true as you heard them."
  * **amazed** - Translate the word "amazed" with a term that means that they were surprised, shocked, and confused about how this could be possible.
  * **Isn't this the son of Joseph?** - This could also be translated as, "This man is only the son of Joseph!" or, "Everyone knows he is just Joseph's son!" The people were not asking if he was Joseph's son or not. They were wondering how he could be the Messiah since they thought he was only the son of an ordinary man.
