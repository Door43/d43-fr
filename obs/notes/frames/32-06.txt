The **man with the demon cried out** in a loud voice, “**What do you want with me**, **Jesus**, **Son** of **the Most High God**? Please do not torture me!” Then Jesus asked the demon, “What is your name?” **He replied**, “My name is **Legion**, because **we are many**.” (A “legion” was a group of several thousand soldiers in the Roman army.)

L'homme possèdé par le démon s'écria d'une voix forte: “Qu'y a t-il entre moi et toi, Jésus, Fils du Dieu Très Haut? je t'en conjure au nom de Dieu, ne me tourmente pas!” Jésus demanda au démon: “Quel est ton nom?” Il répondit: “Légion est mon nom, car nous sommes plusieurs.” (Une “légion” était un groupe de plusieurs milliers de soldats dans l'armée Romaine.)
