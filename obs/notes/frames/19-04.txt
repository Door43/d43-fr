So **Elijah** went to a **neighboring country**. A widow and her son in that country had almost run out of food because of **the famine**. But they **took care of** Elijah, and **God provided for them so that their flour jar and their bottle of oil never became empty**. They had food through the whole famine. Elijah stayed there for several years.

Alors, Elie alla dans un pays voisin. Une veuve et son fils dans ce pays n'avaient presque plus de nourriture à cause de la famine. Mais ils prirent soin d'Elie, donc Dieu pourvut à leurs besoins de manière à ce que leur pot de farine et leur bouteille d'huile ne désemplirent jamais. Ils eurent de quoi manger, pendant toute la durée de la famine. Elie resta avec eux pendant plusieurs années.
