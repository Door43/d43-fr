The soldiers **gambled for Jesus' clothing**. When they did this, **they fulfilled a prophecy that said**, “They divided my garments among them, and gambled for my clothing.”

Les soldats se partagèrent ses vêtements en les tirant au sort. C'est ainsi que s'accomplit cette prophétie de l'Ecriture Sainte qui dit: “Ils se sont partagés mes vêtements et ils ont tiré au sort ma tunique.” C'est exactement ce que firent les soldats.
