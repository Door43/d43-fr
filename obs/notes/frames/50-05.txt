  * **good seed** - This seed was wheat grain. If this type of seed is not known in your language area, it is best to use a general term for "seed." If there is no general term, it may be necessary to choose a type of grain seed that is known and say, for example, "good seed like rice."
  * **weed seeds** - The weed seeds that were planted would grow up as tall grass but could not be eaten. They were useless.
  * **wheat** - That is, "wheat seeds." Wheat is a kind of grain that grows like a tall grass. It has seeds that people use for food.
