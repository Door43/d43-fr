**God made** man and woman **in his own image**. He **blessed** them and told them, “Have many children and grandchildren and fill the earth!” And God saw that everything he had made was **very good**, and he was very pleased with all of it. This all happened on the sixth day of **creation**.

Dieu fit l'homme et la femme à son image. Il les bénit et leur dit “Ayez beaucoup d'enfants et de petits enfants et remplissez la terre!” Et Dieu vit que tout ce qu'il avait fait était très bon et il en était ravi. Tout cela arriva le sixième jour de la création.
