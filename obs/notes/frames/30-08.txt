Then **Jesus broke the bread and the fish** into pieces. He gave the pieces to his **disciples** to give to the people. The disciples kept passing out the food, and **it never ran out**! All the people ate and were satisfied.

Puis Jésus rompit le pain et les poissons. Il donna les morceaux à ses disciples qui les distribuèrent à la foule. Les disciples continuèrent à distribuer la nourriture à la foule, il n'en manqua pas et tout le monde fut rassasié.
