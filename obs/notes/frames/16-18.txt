**Finally**, the people **asked God for a king like all the other nations had**. They wanted a king who was tall and strong, and who could lead them into battle. **God did not like this request**, but he gave them a king just as they had asked.

Finalement, les Israélites demandèrent à Dieu de leur donner un roi semblable à ceux de toutes les autres nations. Ils voulurent un roi grand et fort, capable de les mener au combat. Dieu n'aimait pas cette demande mais il leur donna le roi qu'ils souhaitaient.
