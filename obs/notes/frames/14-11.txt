{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-14-11.jpg?nolink&}}

During the forty years that the people of **Israel** wandered in the wilderness, **God provided for them**. He gave them **bread from heaven**, **called “manna”**. **He also sent flocks of quail** (which are medium-sized birds) **into their camp** so they could have meat to eat. During all that time, God kept their clothes and shoes from wearing out.

Pendant les 40 années que le peuple d'Israël erra dans le désert, Dieu pourvut à leurs besoins. Il fit pleuvoir pour eux du pain, appelé “de la manne”. Il envoya aussi dans leur camp des volées de cailles (qui sont des oiseaux de taille moyenne) pour qu'ils aient de la viande à manger. Pendant tout ce temps, grâce à Dieu, leurs habits et sandales ne se sont pas usés.

==== Translation Notes: ====


  * **God provided for them** – This could be translated as, "God gave them everything they needed for food, water, and shelter."
  * **bread from heaven, called "manna"** - This thin, bread-like food fell from the sky overnight onto the grass like dew. They called it "manna." Almost every day the people gathered this "manna" and cooked it as their food.
  * **He also sent flocks of quail…camp** - Another way to say this would be, "He also caused a large number of quails to fly into their camp." If quails are unknown, a different, similar type bird could be used. Or it could be translated as, "a large number of medium-sized birds."
  * **their camp** - The place where the Israelites set up their tents to sleep in was called a "camp." It was like a city with tents instead of buildings, and it could be moved around.
