As **Peter** was talking, a bright cloud came down and surrounded them and **a voice from the cloud said**, “This is my **Son** whom I **love**. I am pleased with him. **Listen to him**.” The three **disciples** were **terrified** and **fell on the ground**.

Au moment où Pierre parlait, une nuée lumineuse les enveloppa et une voix en sortit qui disait, “Celui-ci est mon Fils bien-aimé qui a toute ma faveur. Ecoutez-le.” Les trois disciples furent saisis de terreur et tombèrent à terre.

  * **terrified**–That is, "extremely scared."
  * **fell on the ground** - That is, "quickly bowed to the ground" or, "immediately got down on the ground." Make sure the translation of "fell" does not sound like an accident. They probably did this intentionally out of awe and fear.
