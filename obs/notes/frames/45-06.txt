{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-45-06.jpg?nolink&}}

A young man named **Saul** agreed with the people who killed Stephen and **guarded their robes** while they threw stones at him. That day, many people in **Jerusalem** started **persecuting** the followers of Jesus, so the **believers** fled to other places. **But in spite of this**, they **preached** about Jesus everywhere they went.

Un jeune homme qui s'appelait Saul approuva l'exécution d'Étienne et garda leurs possessions pendant qu'ils lançaient les pierres. Ce jour-la, beaucoup de gens à Jerusalem commençaient a persécuter les disciples, et ils fuirent dans d'autres régions. Mais, malgré ceci, il prêchait au sujet Jésus partout où ils allaient.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **guarded their robes** - This could be translated as, "watched over their coats." He was probably making sure they didn't get stolen or damaged.
  * **But in spite of this** - The Jewish leaders thought they could stop the spread of Jesus' teaching by persecuting his followers. Instead, this caused them to scatter and spread the message even more widely.
