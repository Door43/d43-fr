The crowd had over 5,000 men in it, **not counting the women and children**. **Jesus** felt great compassion towards the people. **To Jesus**, these people were **like sheep without a shepherd**. So he taught them and **healed** the people among them who were sick.

Il y avait cinq mille hommes dans cette foule, sans compter les femmes et les enfants. Jésus fut pris de compassion pour cette foule. Pour Jésus, ces gens étaient comme des brebis sans berger. Alors il leur apprit beaucoup de choses et il guérit les malades qui étaient parmi eux.
