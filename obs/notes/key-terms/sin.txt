Adam and Eve sinned by eating the fruit that God told them not to eat. Before that there was no sin in the world. Sin is passed from parent to child through the entire human race. God must punish sin.

**Adam et Eve ont peche en mangeant le fruit defendu .Avant que le peche ne soit apparu sur la terre. le peche est passe des parents aux enfants par la race humaine. Dieu doit punir le peche**
