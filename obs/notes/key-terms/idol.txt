====== idol: idole ======

===== Definition: =====

An idol is an object that people make so they can worship it.

**Une idole est un objet que les gens fabriquent pour pouvoir ainsi  l'adorer**

   * People make idols to represent the gods that they worship.
  * **Les gens fabriquent des idoles qui réprentent les dieux qu'ils adorent**
  * These false gods do not exist–there is no God besides Yahweh. Therefore the idols have no power.
  * **Ces  faux dieux n'éxistent pas, il n' y a pas de Dieu à côté de Yahvé**
  * Sometimes things happen by coincidence that make idols seem to have power. Sometimes demons work through idols in order to deceive people.
  * **Parfois les choses arrivent  par coincidance que les idoles fabriquées semblent avoir de pouvoir**
  *
  * Idols are often made of precious materials like gold or silver.
