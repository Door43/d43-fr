===== Examples from the Bible stories: =====

  * **[[:fr:obs:notes:frames:17-12|[17-12]]]** Bathsheba's husband, a man named **Uriah**, was one of David's best soldiers. David called **Uriah**  back from the battle and told him to go be with his wife. But **Uriah**  refused to go home while the rest of the soldiers were in battle. So David sent **Uriah**  back to the battle and told the general to place him where the enemy was strongest so that he would be killed.
