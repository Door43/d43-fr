====== heal guérir ======

===== Definition: Définition =====

To heal is to cause a person's wounds, disease, or disability (such as blindness) to no longer exist. It also means to cause a sick or disabled person to be healthy again.

Guérir est le fait d'amener une blessure, une maladie ou l'handicap d'une personne (telle que la perte de la vue) à disparaitre. Cela veut aussi dire amener une personne malade ou handicapée à retrouver la santé.

  * A person who is healed has been made well.
  * Une personne qui est guérie a retrouvé la santé.
  * Natural healing happens gradually.
  * La guérison naturelle s'effectue graduellement.
  * Miraculous healing normally occur suddenly, as when Peter caused a crippled man to immediately be able to walk.
  * La guérison miraculeuse se produit soudainement comme Pierre a guéri un paralytique qui a marché immédiatement.
