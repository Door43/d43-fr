===== Definition: =====

===== Défintion: =====

A sacrifice is an offering to God of something valuable as a form of worship.

Une sacrifice, c'est une ofrande d'une chose valable à Dieu en forme d'adoration.

  * The Israelites made several different kinds of sacrifices. These included sacrifices to ask God to forgive sin and sacrifices to thank him for blessings.
  * Les israëlites faisaient plusieurs types différents d'offrandes. Parmi ceux, il y avait des sacriices pour demander à Dieu de pardonner les péchés aussi que lui remercier.
  * Most sacrifices involved killing an animal and offering it to God as a gift.
  * La plupart des offrandes exigeaient tuer d'un animal et l'offrir à Dieu comme un don.

Animal sacrifices could never truly make a person clean from his sin. Only the sacrifice of Jesus, God's perfect, sinless Son, can cleanse people from sin.

Les sacrifices d'animaux ne pouvaient jamais purifier complètemente de son péché. Seulement la sacrifice de Jésus, le Fils parfait,  sans péché, peut purifier les gens de ses péchés.
