===== Definition: <font 14px/inherit;;inherit;;inherit>Définition:</font>  =====

A sacrifice is an offering to God of something valuable as a form of worship.

Un sacrifice, c'est offrir une chose de valeur à Dieu sous forme d'adoration.

  * The Israelites made several different kinds of sacrifices. These included sacrifices to ask God to forgive sin and sacrifices to thank him for blessings.
  * Les israëlites faisaient différents types d'offrandes. Parmi elles, il y avait des sacriices pour demander à Dieu de pardonner les péchés et des sacrifices pour le remercier pour les bénédictions.
  * Most sacrifices involved killing an animal and offering it to God as a gift.
  * La plupart des sacrifices impliquaient tuer un animal et l'offrir à Dieu comme un don.

Animal sacrifices could never truly make a person clean from his sin. Only the sacrifice of Jesus, God's perfect, sinless Son, can cleanse people from sin.

Les sacrifices d'animaux ne pouvaient jamais purifier complètement une personne de son péché. Seul le sacrifice de Jésus, le Fils parfait, sans péché, peut purifier les gens de leurs péchés.
