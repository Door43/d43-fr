===== Definition: =====

Dreams are things that people see, hear, and experience in their minds while they are sleeping.

**Les rêves sont les choses qu'une personne voit ou entend pendant qu'ils dorment.  C'est l'expérience de leurs intellectes. **

   * Most of the time, the things that people experience in dreams are not really happening, although while the person is dreaming, it seems that they are.
  * **La plupart du temps, les choses qui font l'expérience des rêves ne se passent pas réelment, quoique pendant que les personnes rêvent, il leur paraîent que ces choses sont réel. **
  * Sometimes God causes people to dream about something so they can learn from it. Sometimes God may speak directly to people in their dreams.
  * **Parfois Dieu amène les gens à rêver à quelque chose ainsi qu'ils puissent apprendre de l'expérience.  Parfois Dieu pourrait parler directement aux gens dans pendant leurs rêves.**
