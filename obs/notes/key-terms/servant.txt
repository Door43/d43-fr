  * A slave is a kind of servant who is the property of the person he works for. Just as people buy clothing and animals, in some parts of the world, people buy people. The person who buys a slave is called his "owner" or "master." Some masters treat their slaves very cruelly while other masters treat their slaves very well.
  * Un esclave est un type de serviteur qui est la propriété de la personne pour laquelle il travaille. Tout comme les gens achètent des vêtements ou des animaux, dans certaines régions du monde, certaines personnes achètent d'autres personnes. La personne qui achète un esclave s'appelle son propriétaire ou son "maître." Certains maîtres traitent leurs esclaves très cruellement pendant que d'autres les traitent très bien.
